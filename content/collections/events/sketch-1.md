        text: 'Established back in 2015, the idea was to create a social space for anyone with an interest in art to come together and meet like-minded people. Sketch has become a regular meet-up for many individuals - whether you’re completely new to drawing, or have been sketching all of your life, you’re always welcome. Oh, and it’s free!'
