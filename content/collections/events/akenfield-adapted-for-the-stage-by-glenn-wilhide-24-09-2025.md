  <p>Akenfield is centred on a fictional village in Suffolk and is a unique record of social history across three generations based around Charsfield and surrounding East Suffolk villages. Taking its lead from Peter Hall's 1975 film which was performed by local people, the stage play of Akenfield has been cast from within the community. Traditional and original music for the production has been composed by leading local Folk musician Finn Collinson, who will be playing live on stage with other musicians during the performances. The beautiful sets are designed by the distinguished sculptor Laurence Edwards with costumes by Constance Mackenzie.</p>

  <p>Produced by SHAKE, the Benhall based theatre company, the new play will initially be performed as 9 previews in Framlingham, Halesworth, Ipswich, Stowmarket and Leiston between September 24th and October 11th.</p>
