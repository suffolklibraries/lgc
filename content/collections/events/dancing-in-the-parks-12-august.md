        text: 'Old Kent Road is a passionate group of tap dancers who are raising the bar in the UK tap dance scene. Bringing their expertise to the British public and sharing the wonder of the art form, they work together to develop distinctive choreography and pay homage to history and jazz culture along the way. This edgy and high energy performance will leave you feeling fantastic! The company will take you through traditional choreography repertoire and expose new concepts within tap dance. Listen out for a range of music from Jazz by Tommy Dorsey where they will perform Harold Cromers legendary piece ‘Opus 1’ to feel good music from Jurassic 5. This set is sure to put a spring in your step.'
