We will be reflecting on this year and our hopes for the New Year through poetry. You will come away with a beautifully written and decorated poem, as well as a creative prompt jar to take with you into your new year to make it the most creative one yet. As well as this we will also be creating a display of little letters with big heart for the library. These little letters might be poems, positive affirmations or compliments that library users can pick up and take home to ignite their new year with a spark of joy. '

        text: 'Poppy Stevens is a community arts practitioner, poet and performer. Her writing has been commissioned and published by The National Centre for Writing, The Young Norfolk Arts Trust, TOAST Poetry, BBC Radio Norfolk & Suffolk & Atrium poetry. Poppy works within the community delivering creative workshops to a diverse range of people. Her work with children spans from EYFS to Key Stage 4 both in schools, alternative provisions, and community settings. Poppy runs a regular dyslexia inclusive writing club. These courses focus on taking the fear out of reading and writing and instead celebrate imagination, creativity, and storytelling. As someone with dyslexia, Poppy understands the importance of creating non-judgemental spaces for young neurodivergent people to express their ideas.'
