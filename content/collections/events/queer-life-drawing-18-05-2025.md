  <p>This is a non hierarchal and untutored life drawing class. We host Queer Life drawing every month at CHiP studios with a new model each time to represent the diversity of the queer community.</p>

  <p>Our sessions are model centered, meaning that the model has full control of the space, they will bring props if they wish, create a playlist for us to enjoy together whatever best represents how they experience their own queer identity.</p>

  <p>Our sessions are informal, you are allowed to bring any materials you wish and connect with other attending artists during the session.</p>

  <p>Sessions last for two hours with a break in the middle for yours and the model's comfort.</p>

  <p>After the session we like to have a show of work with your consent. And at close of session we like to make a trip to a local pub.</p>
