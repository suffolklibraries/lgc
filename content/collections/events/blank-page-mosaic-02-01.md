(Remember, these things will be broken up and permanently cemented into your mosaic, so make sure that they are suitable for this purpose; no family heirlooms!) \_"

Her ceramics also explore the concept of ‘The Contemporary Fossil’; this work reflects on the effect that our throw- away culture will have on the ‘Fossils of our Future’. She loves to share her passion for clay and creativity through teaching workshops, and is a bibliomaniac, with a huge collection of art and craft books.'
