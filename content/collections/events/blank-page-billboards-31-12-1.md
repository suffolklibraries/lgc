You will still be able to create your own digital billboard! The session will include a playful exploration of words and text so that, if you like, you can get your message out there along with your awesome creativity via your billboard. Your digital designs will be shared digitally after the workshop and an A4 printed copy of your digital billboard will be given to you to take home.'

This will be supervised by the staff running the workshops and will also be weather dependent. Please ensure your child has a coat and sensible footwear!'
