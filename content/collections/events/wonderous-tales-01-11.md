He has written three books, Tudor Folk Tales,\_Norfolk Folk tales for Children\_and\_Medieval Folk tales for Children, with a fourth, Trickster Tales from Many Lands, due out in 2025. Dave likes to tell riddles and stories of magic and mystery, myths and monsters and also comic tales about the 'common folkâ€™, the poorer people of long ago."
