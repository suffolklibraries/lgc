        text: "Among the animals, insects are completely unparalleled in terms of species number and the breadth of their lifestyles.\_With so many species and individuals they have their feet in a lot of pies, ecologically speaking. Whether it’s pollination, the recycling of organic matter, the churning of the soil or simply being eaten by larger animals, their reach is immense. Without them, humans wouldn’t survive very long at all. We tend to forget this though and, on the whole, insects are overlooked.\_"

        text: "In Suffolk, we enjoy a climate that is typically warmer and drier than many other parts of the UK. These conditions and the variety of habitats on offer - from\_ancient woodlands, to marshes and the coastal sandlings - make Suffolk one of the best places in the country for insects. Every habitat has its own distinctive assemblage of six-legged inhabitants and taking time to familiarise yourself with just a small proportion of these will provide endless hours of fascination.\_"
