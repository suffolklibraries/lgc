Shoppers can browse approximately 70 stalls around the town centre with a focus on plants, a ‘flower, food and craft market’ on Angel Hill, including local cut flowers, rustic crafts, and artisan food producers. There will also be a Vintage Market.'

        text: 'The urban beach will be outside Moyses Hall and with no danger of being cut off by the tide, visitors can expect to enjoy deckchairs, Punch and Judy shows and feel the sand between their toes without having to sit in bank holiday traffic to reach some of the county’s coastal resorts. Other attractions of the weekend include a helter-skelter, roundabout and astronomy area, with big games including table football and mini golf at arc shopping centre.'
