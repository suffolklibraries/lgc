        text: 'In the Nordic lands, midsummer has an atmosphere that’s all its own. Seas are as blue as the skies, and elemental landscapes come alive with greenery and colourful flowers. And of course, the sun never quite sets; it shines at midnight, and casts an enchanted glow over the dreams and festivities of a culture as ancient as Europe itself.'
