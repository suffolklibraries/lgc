        text: 'A walk across the heath listening out for the distinctive sound of the nightjar. Once darkness falls we will also hope to spot some glow worms.   Wear stout shoes as the ground is uneven, and bring a torch.  Total distance approximately 3 km. Numbers limited so advance booking is essential.'
