        text: 'In this fascinating webinar, Adrian Knowles will reveal the starting point for vegetation in Britain and how early man influenced it. Drawing on his knowledge of history, Adrian will look at how the countryside has changed over the centuries and the clues to the past we can find in old maps, field patterns, place names etc.'

        text: "Suffolk Recorder for Hymenoptera and also Hemiptera, Adrian had his interest in historical geography kindled back in 1987, when working for Hampshire County Council undertaking research on sites of ecological importance using parish tithe maps and similar documents.\_ This started a fascination with maps and place names and how our countryside has evolved, which Adrian developed during work with Essex Wildlife Trust."
