Using collage and paper cut out techniques, we'll create beautiful outdoor scenes. We'll decorate the lid with a decorative numerals '2025.' Inside the box we'll make a reading journal so we can list books we have read and would like to read in 2025. We'll list our new year's resolutions, and then finally write a poem about the year that's gone, or the year ahead (or both if there's time)."
