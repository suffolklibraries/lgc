        text: 'The house martin is a common summer visitor to the UK, arriving in April and leaving in October. It builds mud nests, sometimes in small colonies, under ledges, on cliffs and, as their name suggests, under the eaves of houses, returning to the same nest in years to come. Both males and females help to build the nest, collecting mud from streams and ponds and building up layers with bill-sized pellets. A nest can take them days to build, so reuse saves them a lot of work.'

        text: 'Long time supporter of the house martin, our aptly named presenter, Martin, will share his passion for these birds, their life cycles and what is can be done to support them. He outlines how the colony on his house, which began over 40 years ago with a single natural nest, now numbers 34. The colony now uses artificial nests well as natural ones and is going from strength to strength. Martin will describe ways we can all help house martins when they return to breed in the UK.'
