        text: 'Two time-travelling-rockinâ€™-renegades, The Sister of Stylus, have crash landed in your city and need your help! Their time machine is powered by a new, renewable, sustainable bio-energy source; DANCE. They are on the hunt for all foot-tappers, dad dancers, disco divas, jumping jivers, old school ravers and shake-your-money-makers to thrust, power and pulse them back to the future! Glass House Dance was set up by Sarah Lewis and Laura McGill to take contemporary dance into the heart of the community. They have made their mark on the outdoor arts scene, touring nationally for 8 years.'
