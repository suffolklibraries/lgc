        text: "A highlight of the Festival will be this performance of Daniel Kidane’s violin concerto Aloud. YCAT artist, Sphinx Prize winner, and Classic FM Rising Star Nathan Amaral is a violinist of immense musicality – a perfect fit for this exploration of the momentum and energy between violin and orchestra. It arises from the Russian war on Ukraine (both countries with which he has family ties) and evokes an old remembered Cossack folksong: “Чёрный Ворон” (Black Raven). The song is about a raven circling over an injured Cossack: not only touching, but also fierce. It reminds us that the suffering of ordinary people is often drowned out by political rhetoric. Daniel Kidane says: “it is like an outpouring of Munch's Scream – I really needed to write such a visceral piece just then. And to hear it alongside the tempestuousness of Britten’s Sea Interludes, one of my favourite orchestral interludes, in the Concert Hall, which starts off calm – the two pieces echo each other – it will be special. And Nathan is a very special violinist”."

        text: 'Shostakovich’s Ninth Symphony was trailed by the composer as a major “victory” symphony marking the end of World War II, but it turned out to be somewhat lighter and smaller-scale than expected. Indeed, others of his symphonies have single movements longer than this entire work! It evokes dance, lightheartedness, and even circus, though in the extraordinary Largo it also dwells in “the past which is impossible to forget, even amidst the joys of peaceful life. This minute of concentrated silence is a tribute of love and endless gratitude to those who saved the world and gave humanity back the very possibility of work and happiness. The Soviet artist Shostakovich could not forget these people at this minute of happy festivity” (Ivan Martynov).'
