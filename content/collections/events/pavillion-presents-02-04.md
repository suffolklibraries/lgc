With a beautiful tenor voice and a catalogue of songs that span compassion, social justice, history and humanity, he has captivated audiences for decades across the UK, Europe, North America and the Antipodes.'

        text: 'A Reg Meuross concert is a masterclass in musical storytelling. Accompanying himself on his vintage 1944 Martin six-string guitar, harmonica, tenor guitar, banjo and dulcimer, he draws listeners into the heart and soul of his songs: stories that need telling, lives that need honouring, truths that need unearthing. Across 17 critically acclaimed albums, Reg continues to prove how highly relevant his songs are, whilst reaching new audiences with consistently spellbinding performances.'
