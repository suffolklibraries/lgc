From Wherstead Road, look out for Orwell’s furniture shop and turn into the roadway opposite, which leads under the railway bridge (if you are in a car, park between the trees – if you go under the bridge you may get stuck or have a long way to reverse), walk up the roadway, pass the main allotment gates, and our pedestrian gate will be on your right.'
