        text: 'Centred around singer-songwriter Dan Stock, CUSP know their way around festival-ready anthems, intimate ballads and a broad scope of classic, melodic pop-rock songs. Across their collection of early demos and recordings ‘Songs (Vol.1-3)’ they have set out an early but clear vision of how guitar music still can feel familiar and brand new at the same time.'
