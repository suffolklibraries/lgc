Although the main interest is steam locomotives, all forms of model engineering are encouraged, including traction engines, stationary engines, clocks and general workshop matters. We endeavour to encourage future engineers and welcome younger members, although there is a minimum age of 14 years for juniors who will also need supervision by a parent or guardian.'
