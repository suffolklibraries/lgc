Whether you’re relaxing in the park or experiencing the Lumini, pick up a pair of headphones and be transported by a calming guided meditation written for the gardens or an oral history storytelling experience of voices from the local community. With something for all ages and interests, Memorial Gardens will be buzzing with creativity across all 4 days. We can’t wait to see you.\_"
