        text: 'Red wine substitute is spattered across the painted surfaces suggesting transubstantiation, intoxication and cartoon violence. Reflecting the uncertainties of our times, the population of cartoonish characters the artist depicts seem manic from overexposure, dissolving in a double-take cacophony of contradictory styles and techniques. They appear constructed from the rubble of twentieth century painting, with elements of its major art historical movements stolen and deformed, forced together in eye-popping new combinations. '
