        text: 'Join expert blue badge guides and weave your way around Sudbury’s historic streets which are seeped in silk and wool weaving heritage. Architectural clues and monuments from these trades stand proudly throughout the town; from characterful Weavers’ Cottages, to mighty Silk Mills, Sudbury’s Weavers’ Piece garden packed with dye plants to Sudbury’s three magnificent medieval churches and splendid timber framed buildings, the architectural legacy of the wealth of Sudbury’s wool trade. After the decline of the wool trade, Sudbury’s spinners and weavers turned their skills to the production of lighter fabrics, including silk.'
