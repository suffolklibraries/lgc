        text: 'Seconds of Sound (S.O.S) uses the acronym S.O.S to urge people to dedicate moments to listening, and each track has several seconds associated with it, encouraging listeners to reflect on what they spend their seconds doing. The audio collection is freely available to listen to and download by anyone, anywhere, anytime.'
