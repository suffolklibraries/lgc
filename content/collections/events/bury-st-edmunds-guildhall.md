        text: "The Bury St Edmunds Guildhall is reputedly one of the largest and certainly longest continuously used civic building in England. Its long history began under the shadow of one of the most powerful Benedictine abbeys in the land and as such was a focus of tension between town and abbey. Following the abbey’s dissolution, being the administrative centre of town life for the next 300 years, it witnessed both violence and celebration in equal measure. \_The Guildhall has also played a significant role in shaping the course of the nation’s history, even into the twentieth century and the dark days of the Second World War."
