        text: 'Have fun in the process as you move independently and collaborate with others. It is a session in which everything is voluntary, so there is no pressure on anyone to ‘perform’ – the goal is to learn about the art of creative dance while developing movement skills, awareness of good alignment and safe practice, progressing at our own individual pace & physical ability.
