Keep straight on, passing Ipswich Borough Council gate entrance (DO NOT enter!); you will walk along the outer wall of IBC yard with a flower border and green iron gate on right (ignore this entrance). Go through wooden orchard gate straight ahead, and you will find a boardwalk leading to a second green iron gate. Turn in here and turn right towards greenhouses. Follow shingle path round; if no-one is in greenhouses, go through double wooden gates on right, and turn left to Nursery Cottage.'
