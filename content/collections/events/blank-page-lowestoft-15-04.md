        text: 'Keeping a nature journal is a great way to slow down, look around and connect with the world outside. Through simple step-by-step demonstrations in a relaxed atmosphere, you will learn some of the key processes for bookmaking. Then you will be able to make free choices about layout, design and content for your own hand bound notebook. You will take home a carefully crafted and personalised journal which you can continue to fill with observations, ideas and images in the months to come. There may be opportunities for some fresh air and inspiration outside the library, too.'
