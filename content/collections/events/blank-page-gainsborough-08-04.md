        text: "In this workshop you will learn how to customise objects with recycled comics and magazines to make fun and personalised creations. Decoupage is a traditional craft, used to upcycle objects for the home with colours, pictures, and patterns by using scrap paper and varnish. In the session you can try out the art of collage using paper glue, magazines, and card to get familiar with the techniques. Next you will make a customised keychain charm using decoupage glue and lettering. Moving onto a larger project after lunch, you can use your new decoupage skills to customise your own project, including wooden boxes, coasters, and canvases. What will you create? \_"
