  <p>Ronald Blythe (1922-2023), author of the inimitable <strong>Akenfield,</strong> was a prolific and poetic chronicler of rural and spiritual life, nature and literature. He spent a joyful century close to his Suffolk roots, time-travelling in his imagination and publishing 45 books and thousands of essays. Ian Collins has drawn on decades of friendship for an intimate and candid biography which forms the basis of his talk.</p>

  <p>Ian Collins is a radio and television presenter, author, comedy writer and journalist. And for many years arts writer for the Eastern Daily Press. His numerous biographies and monographs include John Craxton: A Life of Gifts and James Dodds: The Blue Boat.</p>
