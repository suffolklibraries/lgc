        text: 'The garden has its own pedestrian gate – from Halifax Road, walk down the roadway (not accessible to vehicles from either end), keeping the allotment site on your left and Bourne Vale Social Club on your right – the gate is a short walk along the pavement on the left hand side. From Wherstead Road, look out for Orwell’s furniture shop and turn into the roadway opposite, which leads under the railway bridge (if you are in a car, park between the trees – if you go under the bridge you may get stuck or have a long way to reverse), walk up the roadway, pass the main allotment gates, and our pedestrian gate will be on your right.'
