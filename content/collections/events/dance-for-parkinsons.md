        text: 'The components of the dance class, the artistic freedom and the social aspect of English National Ballet’s Dance for Parkinson’s can help with managing daily living with Parkinson’s. Dancing can enhance fluidity of movement, develop postural stability, flexibility of the spine and improve balance, and these classes have been proven to support people with Parkinson’s by developing self-confidence and strength, and temporarily relieving some participants of their day-to-day symptoms. The use of rhythm and voice can also help with cueing movement and expression.'
