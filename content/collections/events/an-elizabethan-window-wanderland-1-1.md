Audiences will enter an Elizabethan world where they will bear witness to privy council conversations and royal entertainment; enlightening, emboldening and enhancing understanding of this fascinating age. You will be challenged to find several ‘hot spots’ to access links to delve deeper into the fascinating history of 1578. '
