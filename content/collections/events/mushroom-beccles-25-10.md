        text: 'Augustine Fogwoode might be the world’s MOST enthusiastic mushroom enthusiast! She is on a quest to make sure everyone knows about the brilliance of fungi: their scientific superpowers and amazing abilities. But it’s just her and her puppet friend Goldie. She might just need a few more fun-guys to make it happen. Join the party and discover how fungi grow, connect and help the natural world, including us humans. Packed full of interactive games, playful music and lots of laughs for all the family, The Mushroom Show is one person’s mission to build a community… and maybe it’ll become your mission too?'
