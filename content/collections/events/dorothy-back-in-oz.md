        text: 'After a huge storm hits Stowmarket, Dorothy finds herself transported back to the magical land of Oz, with only her trusty talking chicken, Billina, for company. But all is not well. The yellow brick road has been smashed and the Emerald City lies in ruins. The Gnome King now sits on the throne and he happens to be wearing a rather fabulous pair of slippers. Dorothy will meet new friends along the way who help her to overcome the Gnome King and restore hope to the people of Oz.'
