Mindfulness is not all about relaxation and ‘inner peace’; it's also about heightening our senses, focusing our minds, and improving our skills - all of which can be instrumental in enriching the lives of the young people around us. Please note - this session is primarily for adults and is not intended to be a workshop for or with young children."
