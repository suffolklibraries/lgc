        text: 'Shostakovich’s second trio dates from August 1944, evoking the horrors and darkness of war as well as the grief at the death of the composer’s closest friend. It is powerfully angry, defiant, bleak, desolate music that’s among the greatest piano trios, especially in the hands of these masterful players.'
