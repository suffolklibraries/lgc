        text: 'The installation will allow you to to make musical conversation by simply being in the space. No music making experience will be needed. At a time when social distancing and polarised arguments have damaged mental health and divided society, this is an opportunity for a variety of social groups and individuals to create beautiful harmony and contemplate each otherâ€™s input. Participants will experience the beauty and harmony that can be created by the warmth we all radiate.'

        text: 'Each participants body turns a rotor above them through rising thermal winds of body heat and breath. The turning rotors trigger musical notes. The notes become part of a composed sequence that changes periodically. The sound is synthesised with coloured light, creating shadow that is projected through the space as the illuminated rotors turn.'
