We’ll dive into what makes you uniquely you by experimenting with creative technologies and sensory materials. You’ll use a blend of drawing, collage, sound-making, and interactive tools to create multi-sensory collages that reflect your identity. As we collaborate, we’ll join our creations together, building a sensory sculpture that shares a story of our collective identity.'
