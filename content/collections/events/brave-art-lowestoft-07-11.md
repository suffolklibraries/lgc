        text: "Hello Brave Artists, As a former assistant head teacher, I have seen the transformative power of the creative arts. My teaching roles have included Art, Design and Technology, and Computing. I am excited to bring my experience and creativity to explore the ideas of others in order to build confidence and self-expression in myself and others.\_Following an MA in Fine Art, my work has evolved into sculpture, new technologies, drumming, and sound. I am passionate about exploring new mediums and techniques.”"
