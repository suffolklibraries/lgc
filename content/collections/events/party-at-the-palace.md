        text: "Step back in time and immerse yourself in the decadence of the restoration period as it is brought to life with a multi-sensory, living history event, recreating the era through enactment, music and dancing. Listen to the costumed musicians playing songs and ballads on instruments from the 1670’s, including a number of original songs about Newmarket, horse-racing and King Charles II. Join in with country dancing; dancers will be on hand to demonstrate and teach you the steps. Have fun with 17th\_century children’s games, including dice and sword play."
