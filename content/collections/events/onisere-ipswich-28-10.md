Enter, the ballet queen, Sandie Mae, who takes Onisere, and her annoying, football mad little brother Tayo, on a fantastical journey through the history of Black British ballet. A journey that begins in 1940s London, and takes in Glasgow, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Johannesburg before landing back in the UK.'
