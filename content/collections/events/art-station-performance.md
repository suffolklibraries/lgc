        text: 'Alexander Costello is an award winning sculptor, video and live artist. Ideas and work are generated through an interest in challenging and exposing the everyday absurdity of perceived normality; the simultaneous pursuit of the infinite and finite; the origin and location of idea; and the exploration of processes that are in themselves the truth in the work, often undermined by a resulting outcome. Misinterpretation and miscommunication of action and language, and an impulse to consistently re-consider form and composition, support and bring balance to endeavours.'
