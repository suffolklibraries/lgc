        text: 'The diminutive migratory Turtle Dove is no longer a common sight during British summers but Operation Turtle Dove and the landowners we work with are working to change that. Turtle Doves need accessible seed and water close to dense thorny nesting habitat to enable them to have more nesting attempts each breeding season. Turtle Doves are ground feeders and need bare ground or low vegetation to be able to land and forage for seed. Tidier landscapes with fewer annual arable plants and less spilt seed means Turtle Doves take longer to get into breeding condition when they arrive back from Africa, where they spend the winter.'

        text: 'This guidance is starting to show signs of success and, coupled with action to stop unsustainable hunting on their flyway to & from Africa, there is real hope that the Turtle Dove’s characteristic call will once again be a sound of summer in the British countryside. Eliza will share her insights into this beautiful iconic dove, its lifestyle, migratory challenges and what we can do in Suffolk to help boost its numbers'
