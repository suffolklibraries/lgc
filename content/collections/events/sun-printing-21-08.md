        text: 'By placing materials, such as dried flowers, onto a specially coated (non-toxic) light-sensitive paper you will create beautiful images as the sunlight changes the colour of the paper. We will rinse the print in water and hang it up to dry. This is where history, art and science meet and the results are magical! You will take away some mini-prints and a keyring as a keepsake.'
