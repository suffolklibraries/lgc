        text: ' – turn right at top of driveway as you face the mansion. After parking, walk along the path round to right, past Sue Ryder stable block café and bowls pavilion on left. Keep straight on, passing Ipswich Borough Council gate entrance (DO NOT enter!); you will walk along the outer wall of IBC yard with a flower border and green iron gate on right (ignore this entrance). Go through wooden orchard gate straight ahead, and you will find a boardwalk leading to a second green iron gate. Turn in here and turn right towards greenhouses. Follow shingle path round; if no-one is in greenhouses, go through double wooden gates on right, and turn left to Nursery Cottage.'
