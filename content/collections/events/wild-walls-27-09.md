        text: 'Exit Through the Gift Shop (2010) directed by Banksy and narrated by Rhys Ifans, tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles who, over the course of several years, filmed a host of street artists at work, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy, but failed to do anything with the footage. Eventually, Banksy decided to use the footage to make a documentary, which includes new footage depicting Guetta''s rise to fame as the artist "Mr. Brainwash". The story is largely related by a disguised Banksy who keeps us guessing whether the Oscar nominated film is a genuine documentary or a mockumentary.'
