        text: 'Lulu is the Creative Director at local community arts organisation Rock Paper Scissors. She has been teaching Art and Design to all ages for over 20 years and worked as a Graphic Designer and Illustrator across different contexts such as Fashion, Textiles, Editorial, Music and Film. Lulu sold her illustrated fashion label through the House of Fraser and showcased a film she made with her husband at Tate Britain. Although her biggest project to date has been growing Rock Paper Scissors from seed with her amazing team, Lulu continues to lovingly work with paper, print and pattern. Sometimes these creations become textile designs, illustrations, moving images, typography, and sometimes they exist only in her favourite place to be, her sketchbook. Lulu is passionate about working with young people, providing a creative and inclusive space for all to shine.'
