Your digital design will be uploaded into a mock-up app so that you can see your work displayed, in its full creative glory, in its street location (think bus stop display or large-scale advertising hoarding). \_"

        text: 'You can expect to come away from the day with skills in digital mixing, editing and an experience of working with layers and layer masks but, if you prefer just to collage, that is awesome too. You will still be able to create your own digital billboard! The session will include a playful exploration of words and text so that, if you like, you can get your message out there along with your awesome creativity via your billboard. Your digital designs will be shared digitally after the workshop and an A4 printed copy of your digital billboard will be given to you to take home.'
