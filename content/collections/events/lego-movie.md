        text: 'Emmet, an ordinary LEGO® figurine who always follows the rules, is mistakenly identified as the Special, an extraordinary being and the key to saving the world. He finds himself drafted into a fellowship of strangers on a mission to stop an evil tyrant’s plans to conquer the world. Unfortunately for Emmet, he is hopelessly, and hilariously, unprepared for such a task, but he’ll give it his all nonetheless.'
