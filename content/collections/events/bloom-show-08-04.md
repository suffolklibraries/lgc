Her stories are as wild as the hair on her head. So when her school enters a storytelling competition, there is no doubt as to whom they should turn for inspiration. . . except that Ginger Jones has lost her imagination! Join her best friend Stan West as he describes the extreme tale of their adventures during the summer holidays. Featuring talking camels, sultans and a possible ruby or two.'

They’re being relied upon to build the planes that could win the war, and they take the responsibility seriously. On this particular day, they’re attempting to build a Wellington bomber in record-breaking time: under twenty-four hours. As temperatures rise and prejudices bubble up, will they be able to pull together in time?'
