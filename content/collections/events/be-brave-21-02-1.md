        text: "This workshop is facilitated by Ben MacPherson.\_Ben is a playful poet and performer who makes work for all ages. He’s been heard on BBC Radio 2, 4extra and BBC Radio Suffolk. You might have seen him live at Latitude, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival or at any other number of live arts events around the country. Hist first book Serious Nonsense for Terribly Grown-Up People came out in 2023 with his follow up Serious Nonsense for the Unbearably Festive following in Autumn 2024. He believes poetry is for everyone and when he isn’t writing and rhyming can be found playing with Lego.\_"
