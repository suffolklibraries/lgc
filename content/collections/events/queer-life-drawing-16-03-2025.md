attendance_information: "18+ Event \r\n\r\nThis is a non hierarchal and untutored life drawing class. We host Queer Life drawing every month at CHiP studios with a new model each time to represent the diversity of the queer community.\r\n\r\nOur sessions are model centered, meaning that the model has full control of the space, they will bring props if they wish, create a playlist for us to enjoy together whatever best represents how they experience their own queer identity.\r\n\r\nOur sessions are informal, you are allowed to bring any materials you wish and connect with other attending artists during the session.\r\n\r\nSessions last for two hours with a break in the middle for your's and the model's comfort.\r\nAfter the session we like to have a show of work with your consent. And at close of session we like to make a trip to a local pub."
