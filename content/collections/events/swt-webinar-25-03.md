        text: "Whilst Suffolk Wildlife Trust owns and manages a total of 2,900 hectares (7,100 acres) of land on 50 nature reserves across Suffolk, these alone cannot provide the space needed for wildlife to recover. It is essential for us all to work together with fellow landowners and communities to prioritise nature for the good of all. Jenny Rawson, wilder landscapes advice manager, will share with us the collaborative Landscape Recovery projects that have taken place across the county and the benefits gained for wildlife.\_"
