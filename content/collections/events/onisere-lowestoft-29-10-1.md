        text: 'Onisere wants to be a ballet dancer but there’s just one problem: she’s black and she’s never seen any other ballet dancers who look like her. Enter, the ballet queen, Sandie Mae, who takes Onisere, and her annoying, football mad little brother Tayo, on a fantastical journey through the history of Black British ballet. A journey that begins in 1940s London, and takes in Glasgow, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Johannesburg before landing back in the UK.'
