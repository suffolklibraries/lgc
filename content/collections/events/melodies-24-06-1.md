        text: 'Both duos took part as Young Artists in 2024’s French Song and Mélodie course with tutors Veronique Gens and Susan Manoff, and now return to present lieder and mélodies as part of this year’s Festival. In the preceding days, they will have enjoyed expert coaching from Benjamin Appl and James Baillieu – which you can experience live in Monday’s masterclass. A wonderful opportunity to be part of the continued growth of some of today’s brightest younger-generation musicians.'
