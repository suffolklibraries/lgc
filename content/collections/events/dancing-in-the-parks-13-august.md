        text: 'Unfamiliar Winds sees two humans embark on a similar, supported journey. Inspired by the oddities in nature and poetry by Derek Jarman, this duet searches for acceptance and the right to be silly in the world around us. Exploring interactions between humans and their greater landscape, through the joys of movement, sculpture and song. The performance invites you to listen, sing and dance in a world where depth and humour are combined, and where the middle of the tornado never looked more inviting.'
