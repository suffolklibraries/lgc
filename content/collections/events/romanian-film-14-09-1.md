Stripped of their fortune, they ask the police for help, but are not taken seriously. The three unlucky fellows have no choice but to hunt down the mobsters on their own.\_"

        text: 'With his low-budget film, Director Paul Negoescu delivers a highly-entertaining road movie, which not only identifies all kinds of social shortcomings along the way, but also gives deep insight into the Romanian soul. No surprise that Two Lottery Tickets became a crowdpleaser in its country of origin!'
