You will learn how to 'finger knit' to make a chunky yarn scarf, then progress onto using a knitting frame and stitching up upcycled fabrics to make simple woolly accessories. There will be the opportunity to try out other ways to customise your winter warmers, such as pom-poms, tassels, and stitching."
