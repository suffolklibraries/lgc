        text: 'This “wonderful, virtuoso brass quintet” presents the world premiere of Benjamin Britten’s Funeral March, newly completed by Bernard Hughes from sketches in our archive. We will hear the first modern performance of his Fanfare for David Webster and three special pieces by Imogen Holst, including her Leiston Suite. The programme also contains a wealth of stirring brass music from the last century including suites by Horovitz and Bernstein, Malcolm Arnold’s Quintet, and Walton’s fantastic Roaring Fanfare.'
