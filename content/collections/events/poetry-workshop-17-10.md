        text: 'Being part of a community and feeling you belong are foundational aspects of human life; they provide stability and a sense of identity. Too often, reality is rather different. A person may become separated from their community because of personal circumstance, conflict or war and have to learn how to belong in a different place. People may have links to more than one community through their heritage and feel they have to negotiate who they are, where they belong.'
