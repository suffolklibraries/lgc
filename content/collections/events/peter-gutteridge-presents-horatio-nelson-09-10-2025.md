  <p>We are delighted to welcome back <strong>Peter Gutteridge</strong> following the fascinating talk he gave us earlier this year on Nelson’s early life. This talk tells the story of how Nelson recovered from the disaster of being seriously wounded at Tenerife (and having his right arm amputated) to becoming the hero of the Battle of the Nile when he annihilated Napoleon’s Fleet at the Bay of Aboukir. Peter’s last visit was such a success and we expect this talk will be just as popular. Early booking advised.</p>

  <p>Peter is a retired senior partner of a large law practice and has Masters’ Degrees in Maritime History from Greenwich University and History from Cambridge University. His interest in Nelson was originally fostered by his grandfather, Professor H.C. Gutteridge who was a distinguished academic and author of ‘Nelson and the Neapolitan Jacobins’.</p>
