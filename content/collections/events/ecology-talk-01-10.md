        text: "Suffolk Recorder for Hymenoptera and also Hemiptera, Adrian had his interest in historical geography kindled back in 1987, when working for Hampshire County Council undertaking research on sites of ecological importance using parish tithe maps and similar documents.\_ This started a fascination with maps and place names and how our countryside has evolved, which Adrian developed during work with Essex Wildlife Trust."

"As we fall into a deepening environmental crisis, it is becoming very clear that the physical Earth and its processes are too important to be overlooked and misunderstood", he says. “Suffolk''s geological story has much to tell”.'
