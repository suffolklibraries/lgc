        text: ' following the fascinating talk he gave us earlier this year on Nelson’s early life. This talk tells the story of how Nelson recovered from the disaster of being seriously wounded at Tenerife (and having his right arm amputated) to becoming the hero of the Battle of the Nile when he annihilated Napoleon’s Fleet at the Bay of Aboukir. Peter’s last visit was such a success and we expect this talk will be just as popular. Early booking advised.'
