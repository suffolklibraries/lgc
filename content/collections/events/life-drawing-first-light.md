        text: 'The artist’s figurative paintings and drawings often depict curious characters caught up in uncanny situations. Influenced by magical-realism and lifting motifs from diverse sources such as Flemish still life, baroque art and Weimar painters, the artist enters into conversation with the history of painting with the aim of bringing a present-day sensibility to the table.'
