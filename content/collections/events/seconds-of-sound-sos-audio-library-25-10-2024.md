Seconds of Sound (S.O.S) is an educational, archival audio library of environmental sounds capturing Suffolk’s landscape through Spring, Summer and Autumn in the year 2024. The project uses the acronym S.O.S to urge people to dedicate moments to listening, and each track has several seconds associated with it, encouraging listeners to reflect on what they spend their seconds doing. The audio collection is freely available to listen to and download by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

The collection was created by teacher and field recordist Martin Scaiff, as Environmentalist in Residence for Suffolk Libraries. Martin is the founder of HomeSounds, a research-informed project which invites everyone, particularly young people in vulnerable circumstances, to become active environmental listeners for the benefit of their creativity, education, health, and wellbeing.
