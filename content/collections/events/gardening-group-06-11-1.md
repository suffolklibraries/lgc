        text: 'When you lose someone, the grief will never go away completely — but there are healthy ways to cope. Some people find that gardening as they grieve, can gently relieve some of the emotional and physical symptoms after the loss of a loved one. Gardening has many therapeutic benefits; it’s a sensory process of creating and healing, packed with colour, texture and fragrance, rain or shine. Gardens are both active to work and restful to sit in, helping us to relax and let go, taking a break away from our worries to breathe in nature.'
