Audiences will enter an Elizabethan world where they will bear witness to privy council conversations and royal entertainment; enlightening, emboldening and enhancing understanding of this fascinating age. As part of the journey you will be challenged to find several ‘hot spots’ to access links to delve deeper into the fascinating history of 1578. '
