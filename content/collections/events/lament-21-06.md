        text: "Juliet Fraser is known for her inventive programming and commitment to exploring new forms of vocal expression. This time, however, she's experimenting with a whole new way of making. A small ensemble of stellar international artists will gather for a residency in Snape in the spring to co-create this hour-long, late-night “ritual of letting go”."

        text: 'Juliet Fraser writes: “Song has always been used to mark the significant moments in a life, whether of celebration, transition, healing or grief. Inspiration for this new sequence of music and movement is drawn from circular rituals such as the canonical hours, antiphonal structures such as weaving songs, and the slow march of a funeral procession. Music from earlier times and other traditions will sit alongside two new laments by Soosan Lolavar and James Weeks, the old and the new speaking to one another across history and geography.”'
