        text: 'Dr Ed Drewitt has been studying the food of urban peregrines for 27 years and supported hundreds of students in dissecting owl pellets, the regurgitated undigested packages of their food. In his latest book, Bird Pellets, Ed provides a photographic guide to the different pellets birds produce, from eagles and owls to robins and blackbirds, and how to identify what is inside them. The book in particular helps you to identify small mammal and bird skulls.'
