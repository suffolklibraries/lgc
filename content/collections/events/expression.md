        text: 'Expression is a three-part creative confidence building workshop, in which young people will work on a piece of mix-media artwork, across three sessions. The sessions are then embedded with a variety of confidence building activities such as: positive language and writing personal mantras, coping mechanisms and the importance of emotional fitness, plus setting personal and achievable goals. There will also be a little bit of art theory during the creative activities to help encourage the young people to use colour and shape to express their feelings.'
