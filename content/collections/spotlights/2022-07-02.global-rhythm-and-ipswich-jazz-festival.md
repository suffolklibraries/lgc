  Global Rhythms and The Ipswich Jazz Festival have joined forces to bring you this free festival in the beautiful surroundings of Christchurch Park.

  There’ll be something for everyone in Ipswich’s colourful celebration of worldwide music and culture. Five stages will feature some of the world’s best musicians, and there will be fairground rides, a craft market, live music and art and food from across the globe.

  There is also a full programme of workshops throughout the day where you can experience music, dance and culture up-close and personal, with some of the fantastic artists that perform at the festival.
