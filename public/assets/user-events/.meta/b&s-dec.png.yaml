  alt: 'Festive poster for Suffolk Pride’s “Btch & Stitch” event, with a green background decorated with white snowflakes and dots resembling falling snow. Centered is a cartoon mouth with red lips and two hands knitting blue yarn across the lips using needles. Above the lips, a white speech bubble says “Btch & Stitch” in bold red and black letters, with a star replacing the "I" in "B*tch." In the bottom left corner, the Suffolk Pride triangle logo is adorned with a red Santa hat. Event details in bold black and white text at the bottom read: “Thursday 18th December, 7 PM – 9 PM, Geek Retreat, IP1 1DU.” The poster promotes a festive, queer-friendly social gathering centered on crafts and connection.'
